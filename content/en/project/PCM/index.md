The idea of using structure for storage dates back to the 1960's with the seminal work of Stanford
Ovshinsky who proposed a four component chalcogenide alloy as a form of nonvolatile 
electrical memory. The higher power requirements of the phase-change memory (PCM)
limited its application until the 1980's when the pioneering work at Matsushita lead to
the development of Ge-Sb-Te PCM alloys and its application to re-writeable optical discs.
This has now lead to optical disc storage capacities to exceed 50 GB. Moreover, the same 
Ge-Sb-Te alloys are now employed in the form of storage-class memory (as epitomized by Intel's
Optane memory subsystems), a form of nonvolatile
electrical memory with latencies and write times within a factor of 10 of DRAM alleviating the 
bottlenecks associated with the larger latency of the denser nonvolatile FLASH memory. Even
more recently a new variation of electrical memory called interfacial phase-change memory
(iPCM) has appeared which uses highly oriented superlattices of GeTe and Sb2Te3 to achieve more 
than a factor of ten reduction in energy requirements by use of what is thought to be a crystalline-crystalline 
transition. The figure above represents a possible atomic level model for the switching process
in iPCM devices.
