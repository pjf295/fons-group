Ultrafast measurements of chemical reactions and phonon behavior have been carried out using
time-resolve synchrotron radiation-based x-ray absorption, free-electron laser diffraction,
as well as all-optical pump-probe experiments. Above is a plot of the time-dependence of
a free-electron based optical-pump/ x-ray probe diffraction experiment on a Ge₂Sb₂Te₅ single epilayer (left) along with
a simulation of the diffraction signal based upon the propagation of the acoustic phonon generated
by the 20 fs optical pump pulse.
