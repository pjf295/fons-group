abstract: Phase-change materials based on Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in industrial
 applications such as nonvolatile memories, but reaction pathways for 
 crystalline-to-amorphous phase-change on picosecond timescales remain unknown. 
 Femtosecond laser excitation and an ultrashort x-ray probe is used to show the temporal 
 separation of electronic and thermal effects in a long-lived (>100 ps) transient 
 metastable state of Ge2Sb2Te5 with muted interatomic interaction induced by a weakening
  of resonant bonding. Due to a specific electronic state, the lattice undergoes 
  a reversible nondestructive modification over a nanoscale region, remaining cold for 4 ps.
  An independent time-resolved x-ray absorption fine structure experiment confirms the
 existence of an intermediate state with disordered bonds. This newly unveiled effect allows
 the utilization of non-thermal ultra-fast pathways enabling artificial manipulation of
  the switching process, ultimately leading to a redefined speed limit and improved energy
   efficiency and reliability of phase-change memory technologies

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
