abstract: Phase-change materials experience unusually large changes in material properties between amorphous and crystalline phases
 allowing them to be used as a form of memory. In this paper, we directly measure the local 
 structure of the amorphous and crystalline phases using x-ray absorption spectroscopy. 
 We demonstrate that the prototypical phase-change alloy Ge2Sb2Te5, the material of choice
 in optical and electrical phase-change memory, does not possess the rocksalt structure but 
 likely consists of well-defined rigid building blocks that are randomly oriented in space consistent
 with cubic symmetry. Amorphization leads to a drastic shortening of covalent bonds 
 and a decrease in the mean-square relative displacement, demonstrating a substantial 
 increase in the degree of short-range ordering, in sharp contrast to the amorphization
  of typical covalently bonded solids.
