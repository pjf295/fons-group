Due to the complexity and volume of the output, this can lead to challenges in interpreting the generated output. Here well use CEGANN: Crystal Edge Graph Attention Neural Network for multiscale classification of materials environment[1] In this example, we represent bonds between atoms as well as bond angle information in a mathematical graph in an attention based architecture. These graphs are then introduced as an input layer to a convolutional neural network to \u0026ldquo;learn\u0026rdquo; the local environment about atoms in the three-dimensional structure. By training on amorphous and crystalline structures generated using ab-initio* molecular dynamics, the nature of a site in a three-dimensional network can be distinguished as being crystalline or amorphous in nature.\n[1] S.

The figure above shows the charge-density difference (CDD) for a cross-section of the GeTe lattice which has both short and long bonds. The CDD plot is constructed by taking the difference between the charge density of the solid and pseudo-atoms.

The higher power requirements of the phase-change memory (PCM) limited its application until the 1980\u0026rsquo;s when the pioneering work at Matsushita lead to the development of Ge-Sb-Te PCM alloys and its application to re-writeable optical discs. This has now lead to optical disc storage capacities to exceed 50 GB. Moreover, the same Ge-Sb-Te alloys are now employed in the form of storage-class memory (as epitomized by Intel\u0026rsquo;s Optane memory subsystems), a form of nonvolatile electrical memory with latencies and write times within a factor of 10 of DRAM alleviating the bottlenecks associated with the larger latency of the denser nonvolatile FLASH memory. Even more recently a new variation of electrical memory called interfacial phase-change memory (iPCM) has appeared which uses highly oriented superlattices of GeTe and Sb2Te3 to achieve more than a factor of ten reduction in energy requirements by use of what is thought to be a crystalline-crystalline transition. The figure above represents a possible atomic level model for the switching process in iPCM devices.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"4ffaecf74d57c23dd0b4155ecfbdd2e8","permalink":"/project/pcm/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pcm/","section":"project","summary":"Materials whose structure is used for storage.","tags":["PCM"],"title":"Phase-Change Materials","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The structure and properties of amorphous materials have been traditionally hard to analyze as one of the most ubiquitous tools for structural analysis x-ray (Bragg) diffraction is not applicable.

Our group specializes in using a combination of synchrotron based techniques such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy, high-energy photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as total scattering to experimentally determine the local structure of amorphous materials.
