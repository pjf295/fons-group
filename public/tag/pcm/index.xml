      <title>Density-Functional Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Density-functional theory (DFT) is used to predict a variety of material properties. In addition,
ab-initio molecular dynamics based upon DFT is used to examine structural dynamics and
to generate metastable (amorphous phases) by means of a melt-quench process. The plane-wave codes
VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package), CASTEP (CAmbridge Serial Total Energy Package),
as well as the FP-(L)APW+lo code Wien2K are used to investigate both structural and electronic
properties of samples under study. In addition the real-space Greens function code Feff9 and
FMDNES codes are used for the simulation of x-ray absorption data. The figure above shows the charge-density difference (CDD)
for a cross-section of the GeTe lattice which has both short and long bonds. The CDD plot is constructed
by taking the difference between the charge density of the solid and pseudo-atoms. As such the pileup
of charge between two atoms is suggestive of a covalent bond as describe by Pauling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast measurements of chemical reactions and phonon behavior have been carried out using
time-resolve synchrotron radiation-based x-ray absorption, free-electron laser diffraction,
as well as all-optical pump-probe experiments. Above is a plot of the time-dependence of
a free-electron based optical-pump/ x-ray probe diffraction experiment on a Ge₂Sb₂Te₅ single epilayer (left) along with
a simulation of the diffraction signal based upon the propagation of the acoustic phonon generated
by the 20 fs optical pump pulse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of using structure for storage dates back to the 1960&amp;rsquo;s with the seminal work of Stanford
Ovshinsky who proposed a four component chalcogenide alloy as a form of nonvolatile
electrical memory. The higher power requirements of the phase-change memory (PCM)
limited its application until the 1980&amp;rsquo;s when the pioneering work at Matsushita lead to
the development of Ge-Sb-Te PCM alloys and its application to re-writeable optical discs.
This has now lead to optical disc storage capacities to exceed 50 GB. Moreover, the same
Ge-Sb-Te alloys are now employed in the form of storage-class memory (as epitomized by Intel&amp;rsquo;s
Optane memory subsystems), a form of nonvolatile
electrical memory with latencies and write times within a factor of 10 of DRAM alleviating the
bottlenecks associated with the larger latency of the denser nonvolatile FLASH memory. Even
more recently a new variation of electrical memory called interfacial phase-change memory
(iPCM) has appeared which uses highly oriented superlattices of GeTe and Sb2Te3 to achieve more
than a factor of ten reduction in energy requirements by use of what is thought to be a crystalline-crystalline
transition. The figure above represents a possible atomic level model for the switching process
in iPCM devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure of Amorphous Materials</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The structure and properties of amorphous materials have been traditionally hard to analyze
as one of the most ubiquitous tools for structural analysis x-ray (Bragg) diffraction is not
applicable. On the other hand, the material properties of the amorphous phase have proven to be
very useful for applications. A case in point is phase-change memory which utilizes the properties
differences between crystalline and amorphous phases for data storage. Our group specializes
in using a combination of synchrotron based techniques such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy,
high-energy photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as total scattering to experimentally determine the local
structure of amorphous materials. These experimental results in conjunction with density-functional
theory-based analysis and ab-initio molecular dynamics has allowed the unraveling of the
unique properties of different phase-change alloys.&lt;/p&gt;
